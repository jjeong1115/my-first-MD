# What are chatbots? 
Chatbot: A computer program that simulates human conversation with an end user
- Not all chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence, but modern chatbots increasingly use conversational AI techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) to understand user questions and automate responses to them.

## Types of chatbots
### 1. Rule-Based Chatbots
Rule-based chatbots are the simplest form of chatbots. These chatbots are designed to follow predefined rules to respond to customer inquiries. They operate based on a decision tree, where each answer leads to a new set of questions, and the AI chatbot provides the most relevant solution based on the input received. Rule-based chatbots handle basic customer inquiries like password resets, FAQs, or order tracking.

### 2. AI-Based Chatbots[^1]
AI-powered chatbots use **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** algorithms to understand and respond to customer inquiries. These chatbots are more advanced than rule-based ones and can handle complex queries and conversations, such as password resets, account updates, and employee onboarding. They learn from past conversations to improve their responses over time and provide a more personalized experience to customers.

### 3. Hybrid Chatbots
Hybrid chatbots are a combination of rule-based and AI-powered chatbots. They use predefined rules to handle basic customer inquiries and switch to AI-powered mode for more complex queries. Hybrid chatbots provide customers a seamless experience and ensure they receive the best possible support.
