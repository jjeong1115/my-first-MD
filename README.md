## What Is a Chatbot?

Chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation with an end user. Not all chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), but modern chatbots increasingly use conversational AI techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) to understand user questions and automate responses to them. Customers often use chatbots for quick answers to questions about products or services or for help with simple tasks such as booking appointments or tracking orders. Customer service teams can also use chatbots to handle routine inquiries, allowing them to focus on more complex customer needs. This helps deflect cases, reduce agent burnout, streamline processes, and improve customer service metrics such as customer satisfaction score (CSAT).

## Types of chatbots

### 1. Rule-Based Chatbots

Rules-based chatbots follow predefined rules to respond to common issues. They're ideal for answering FAQs or performing basic tasks. Example: a chatbot that helps you find store hours or basic product information.

### 2. AI-Powered Chatbots

AI-powered chatbots use AI to understand and respond to more complex queries. They leverage customer data and learn from interactions over time, enhancing their ability to handle diverse conversations. For example, virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa. 

### 3. Hybrid Chatbots

Hybrid chatbots combine rules-based and AI-powered approaches. They handle straightforward tasks with rules and use AI for more complex interactions. Example: customer service bots that escalate complicated issues to human agents.

### 4. Voice-Activated Chatbots

Voice-activated chatbots respond to spoken commands using voice recognition technology. They're commonly found in smart devices. For example, the Siri bot used in Apple-brand smartphones.

### 5. Contextual Chatbots

Contextual chatbots use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to understand the context of a conversation. They remember your past interactions to provide more accurate responses. Example: ecommerce bots that suggest products based on previous purchases.

## What Makes a Good Chatbot?

### Accuracy & Relevance

- Correct & Useful Responses: Provides accurate answers based on reliable data
- Handles Ambiguity Well: Asks clarifying questions if a userâ€™s request is unclear
- Avoids Overpromising: Knows its limits and escalates to a human agent when needed

### User-Friendly Design

- Simple & Intuitive: Easy to navigate with clear prompts and buttons (e.g., quick replies)
- Fast & Efficient: Responds quickly without unnecessary delays
- Multimodal Support: Can handle text, voice, images, and even file uploads if needed

### Problem-Solving Ability & Helpfulness

- Solves Real Problems: Assists with common user needs (customer support, FAQs, bookings, etc.)
- Proactive Suggestions: Recommends next steps (e.g., "Would you like to track your order?")
- Seamless Handoff to Humans: Transfers to a live agent smoothly when the issue is too complex

### Continuous Learning & Improvement

- Learns from Interactions: Uses machine learning to improve responses over time
- Feedback Mechanism: Asks users for ratings (e.g., "Was this helpful?") to refine performance
- Regular Updates: Adapts to new trends, user needs, and business changes

### Security & Privacy

- Data Protection: Complies with GDPR, CCPA, or other privacy regulations
